# GSM + GPS Tracker Project

This project is a small, Arduino-based GSM + GPS tracking device designed to run from a Li-ion battery and send location data through a SIM800L module.
The goal is to build a compact, portable emergency tracker that can send location information when activated.

# It uses three main modules:

Arduino Nano (main controller)

SIM800L (GSM communication)

NEO-6M GPS (location tracking)


# What This Device Does

Reads GPS coordinates

Sends them via SMS using the SIM800L

Runs from a rechargeable Li-ion battery

Charges over USB-C

Will later be built on a custom PCB and enclosed in a printed case


# Project Roadmap

 []Build a working breadboard prototype

 []Write and test the full firmware

 [x]Finish PCB

 []Design and print the case
