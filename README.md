# SOS Nugget
SOS Nugget is a DIY emergency beacon featuring an Arduino Nano, SIM800L GSM, and NEO-6M GPS module. When activated via a physical SOS button, the device automatically retrieves the current GPS coordinates and transmits them via SMS to a configured emergency phone number.
The project includes a battery-powered power system (TP4056 charger, MT3608 5V boost, LM2596 adjustable buck) and is optimized for stable SIM800L operation with proper filtering capacitors. All wiring, firmware, and PCB files are included.
